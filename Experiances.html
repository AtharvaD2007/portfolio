                <p>I had the opportunity to attend an Apache Kafka meet-up, and it turned out to be a great learning experience.I was introduced to MCP and gained a deeper understanding of how Kafka systems actually work , from how data flows through the system to how scalability and reliability are handled. Many of these concepts were completely new to me, and that's what made the session especially valuable.Grateful to the speakers :Shruti Mantri for a wonderful session on MCP Server for Kafka,Bismeet Singh for explaining Exactly once Semantics in Kafka, Kalpak Raut for making us understand Kafka's Architecture.Also to the community for sharing their knowledge and experiences. Looking forward to learning more and attending similar sessions in the future! </p>

                    <p>An Insightful Industry Session Experience .I had the wonderful opportunity to attend an eye-opening session on:“The Engineer's Toolkit: From Code to Commercial Success”.The session was led by Mr. Deep Gandhi, Management Consultant, Infosys Consulting , and it was genuinely inspiring.His insights on how engineers can bridge the gap between technical skills and real-world business impact were incredibly valuable. From understanding client needs to aligning technical solutions with commercial outcomes, every point felt practical and empowering.Feeling grateful for the exposure and excited to apply these learnings in my own journey. </p>

                    <p>I attended this insightful VIDNET 2025 summit on the future of streaming, and it was a great learning experience, especially from a tech perspective.From hybrid monetisation models to tech-driven audience measurement, AI-powered storytelling, subscription video, and smarter streaming infrastructure, every session highlighted how deeply technology is shaping the next wave of OTT. Hearing experts from SonyLIV, Google, Shemaroo, Akamai, Balaji and more, reinforced how innovation, data, and tech-led strategies are redefining content, engagement, and user experience. Also got a chance to click a photo with film director Aditya Sarpotdar. As a tech student, it was inspiring to see how much opportunity lies at the intersection of technology and media.</p>
